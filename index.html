                    <p>This text set includes four informational texts and a video. All deal with an aspect of how inventions solve problems.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold"><i>Thinking Like an Inventor</i></span> is the anchor text for this set. Depending on the needs of your class, you may choose to assign <span class="bold"><i>Thinking Like an Inventor</i></span> for independent reading, or you may choose to read it aloud with the class. Beginning with the anchor text will ground students in concepts and academic vocabulary that are key to discussing the Big Question. As students read the other texts in the set, they will compare their new understandings, as well as the structure and features of the text, with the anchor text.</p>
                    <p>After students read the anchor text, you may choose to assign specific texts or encourage students to choose the texts that appeal to them the most. Use the chart below to see where specific text structures and features appear across the texts in this set.

                    <p><span class="bold uppercase">Big Question</span><br> Remind students of the Big Question: <i>How can inventions solve problems or make life better?</i> Show students a photo of earmuffs or a pair of earmuffs and ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What problem do you think earmuffs would solve? How does warm clothing make life better?</span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the words <i><span class="bold">design </span></i> and <i><span
                                class="bold">improve.</span></i> Discuss the meaning of each word with the class. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">An inventor <span class="bold">designs </span>an invention by deciding how it will look or work. How could you design something to keep people warm in the winter? When you <span
                                class="bold">improve</span> something, you make it better. Think about something you wrote or made. How could you improve it?</span></p>

                    <p><span class="bold uppercase">Oral Vocabulary</span><br> Some of the vocabulary in <i>Chester Greenwood’s Earmuffs</i>
                        includes words that might be new or challenging. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span
                            class="blue_scripting">What
                            <span class="bold">material </span> did Chester use in his earmuffs? Which changes helped to <span
                                class="bold">improve</span> the invention?</span> </p>
                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Word Web</span></h3>
                    <p>Share a Word Web graphic organizer. To help students think about the relationships between words, guide them in creating a Word Web using the word <i>design</i>. When they read <i>Chester Greenwood’s Earmuffs</i>, encourage them to add words to their web that relate to this word. A web for <i>design </i> might look like this: </p>

                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="assets/images/TextSets_WordCloud_Moon_Text3.svg" alt="A word web with phase in the center, and with new moon, full moon, gibbous and crescent branching from it."

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Structure</span> Explain that <i>Chester Greenwood’s Earmuffs</i> is written with a problem and solution structure. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">In this text, a boy thinks about a problem and finds a way to fix it.</span> Have students preview the section titled A Cold, Cold Problem. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">What problem is the writer describing? How do you think Chester can solve it?</span> </p>
                    <p>Display a T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the left column, write “Problem and Solution Structure.” Work with the class to fill in the column with what they know about problem and solution structure, and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “describes a problem” and “tells how a problem was solved”</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Diagrams are special features. They are images, or pictures, that can show the parts of something or the way something works.</span> Direct students’ attention to the diagram of the earmuffs. Point out one part of the diagram, and have students read the label with you. Say:
                        <span class="blue_scripting">The labels name parts of the diagram.</span> Continue with the remaining labels. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">Why do you think the author included a diagram with this text?</span> Guide students to understand that the diagram helps them recognize the parts of the earmuffs that are discussed in the text.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Return to the T-chart. At the top of the right column write “Diagram.” Work with the class to fill in the column with examples of how the diagram helps readers understand the text. For example: “shows the parts of an invention,” “shows how something works”</p>

What kinds of problems do you think you’ll learn about in the text?</span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the words <i><span class="bold">improve, energy,</span></i> and <i><span class="bold">solution.</span></i> Discuss the meaning of each word with the class. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">We can use <span class="bold">energy</span> such as solar power. What can we use energy for? How does solar energy <span class="bold">improve</span> our lives, or make them better? A <span class="bold">solution</span> is a way of fixing a problem. What is a problem that people might have in space? What might be a solution to the problem?</span></p>

                        <i><span class="bold">renewable.</span></i> Discuss the meaning of each word with the class. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What are some examples of <span class="bold">energy</span>? How do <span class="bold">inventions</span> help people get energy? When a resource is <span class="bold">renewable</span>, we can always get more of it. Why is it important to use renewable energy?</span></p>

                    <p>Some of the vocabulary in <i>Clean Energy Inventions</i> includes words that might be new or challenging. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">Solar energy comes from the sun. Why do you think solar energy is a <span class="bold">renewable</span> resource?</span> </p>
                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Word Web</span></h3>
                    <p>Share a Word Web graphic organizer. To help students think about the relationships between words, guide them in creating a Word Web using the word <i>energy</i>. As they read <i>Clean Energy Inventions</i>, encourage them to add words to their web that relate to this word. A web for <i>energy</i> might look like this:
                    </p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">

                    <p>An important part of building a vibrant classroom culture is creating an atmosphere in which all
                        students feel empowered to participate in powerful classroom conversation. You may have noticed
                        that
                        your students who are naturally extroverted often participate freely in a whole-class
                        discussion,
                        while those who are more introverted or, perhaps, who come from cultures that respect different
                        classroom norms, may need encouragement to share. You can use sentence prompts like these to
                        invite
                        all students into the conversation:</p>
                    <p>“That’s so interesting … please tell me more!”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone explain that in a different way?”</p>
                    <p>“What are some examples of that?”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone add on to that idea?”</p>
                    <p>Sharing and discussing ideas will often involve agreeing and/or disagreeing with what others say.
                        As
                        students listen carefully and respond thoughtfully to their classmates’ ideas, encourage them to
                        express themselves in respectful and constructive ways. You may wish to post these sentence
                        starters
                        prominently, so students can refer to them often:</p>
                    <p>“I agree, and I also think <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
                    <p>“I mostly agree, but <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
                    <p>“I like what you just said because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
                    <p>“I respectfully disagree because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
